# Hello!
This is my newest GitHub repository for every single one of my install scripts.

I am setting this up because I am going to attempt to mirror this repo on my openSUSE Tumbleweed PC that I will use as a faster way to download my scripts because I reinstall distros frequently

I will be doing releases when I catch a bug or when someone points out a bug to me.

Releases will only be for a specific distro and won't have scripts for every distro.

Distros that work with my package install script are put under their package manager and they are as follows:

**pacman**
- Arch Linux
- EndeavourOS
- Manjaro

**apt**
- Debian

**dnf**
- Fedora
- AlmaLinux

**apk**
- Alpine

**eopkg**
- Solus

**zypper**
- openSUSE Tumbleweed

If anyone finds a distro that works with the install scripts that I publish, please send me a DM on Discord (you can find my server at linktr.ee/greekievialinux) and I will add it to this list.

The source code won't include the VirtualBox .deb and .rpm files for Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE because they are too large to be uploaded to GitHub, so they will only be in the .7z, .tar.gz, and .zip releases.

# Suggesting Distros to add install scripts
I wont be taking suggestions bcuz these are for distros that I use, I will only be taking suggestions for distros *IF* there is a good reason for me to actually use it, and by good, I don't mean "iT hAs VeRy LiTtLe BlOaT" because Linux is one of the most debloated Operating System families, aside from maybe any BSD distro.

# Disclaimers
When I test the scripts, **they will only be tested within Arch, Debian, Fedora, Alpine, Solus, and openSUSE Tumbleweed, unless there is a distro-specific error**, and in the unlikely, but very likely for RPM-based distros, event that the script won't work at all.

**There is an error in pacman-based distros where you have to restart your computer for Vesktop to appear**
